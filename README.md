# bruteforcepi
## JavaScript for brute forcing calculation of π

This previously used random pixels to calculate π which proved to be too
inaccurate. It now methodically checks every pixel at increasing resolutions to
slowly get more accurate in the calculation of π.

### New features:

* Square pixels for less aliasing 
* Smart threading to balance performance and browser overhead
* Better accuracy and performance statistics
* Better ES6 syntax
